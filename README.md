![Demo] (https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19161360/17022480/c5be3f9e-4f6b-11e6-990e-d65586dce067.gif)

This program is written in swift language and it is my first program which is written in swift language.
This animation like explorer section animation in iTune application.

Approach:
When user taps a row then we are calculating content offset point abd creating three image:
    . Before load table top part image
    . Before load table bottom part image
    . After load table image
    
First we are adding images and removing with animation.

After sucessful animation we are creating sections with row 0 for previousally selected options.
When user taps section then we are merging cell with same image approach.
